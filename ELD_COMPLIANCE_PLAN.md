# ELD System Enhancement Plan
## Missing FMCSA HOS Compliance Features

Based on the official **Interstate Truck Driver's Guide to Hours of Service (April 2022)**, here are the critical features missing from your current SpotterAI system:

---

## 🚨 Priority 1: Critical Compliance Features

### 1. **Sleeper Berth Split Rest Breaks** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Regulation:** § 395.1(g)

**What's Missing:**
- Driver can split 10-hour rest into two periods:
  - **Option 1:** 7 consecutive hours + 3 hours (either order)
  - **Option 2:** 8 consecutive hours + 2 hours (either order)
- Neither period counts against 14-hour driving window when paired
- Must track "calculation periods" between paired rest breaks

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# New fields needed in schedule
{
    'rest_break_type': 'split_sleeper',  # or 'full_rest'
    'sleeper_segment': 1,  # or 2 (for split breaks)
    'paired_with': 'break_id_123',  # Link to other half of split
    'excludes_from_14hr': True  # Whether this break pauses 14-hr clock
}
```

**UI Changes:**
- Add option: "Use Split Sleeper Berth" checkbox
- Show calculation periods in schedule
- Highlight paired breaks visually

---

### 2. **Proper 60/70-Hour Rolling Limits** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Regulation:** § 395.3(b)

**What's Missing:**
- Track ALL on-duty hours (not just driving) for past 7 or 8 days
- "Rolling" calculation - oldest day drops off each day
- Two modes:
  - 60 hours in 7 consecutive days (companies not operating daily)
  - 70 hours in 8 consecutive days (companies operating every day)

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# New database fields
driver_hos_history = {
    'daily_hours': [
        {'date': '2025-10-14', 'on_duty_hours': 11},
        {'date': '2025-10-15', 'on_duty_hours': 10.5},
        # ... last 7-8 days
    ],
    'mode': '70/8',  # or '60/7'
    'hours_available': 18.5  # Remaining in current period
}
```

**UI Changes:**
- Display "Hours Available This Week: XX/70"
- Show daily breakdown for last 8 days
- Warning when approaching limit

---

### 3. **34-Hour Restart Option** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Regulation:** §§ 395.3(c)(1) and (c)(2)

**What's Missing:**
- After 34+ consecutive hours off duty, driver's weekly hours reset to zero
- Optional (not mandatory)
- Must be truly consecutive (no work interruptions)

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# Check if 34-hour restart occurred
if last_rest_break >= 34 hours:
    weekly_hours_used = 0  # Reset counter
    calculation_start_date = end_of_34hr_break
```

**UI Changes:**
- Show message: "34-Hour Restart Available" when beneficial
- Button: "Schedule 34-Hour Restart"

---

## 🎨 Priority 2: ELD Log Visual Compliance

### 4. **Proper 24-Hour Graph Grid** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** WRONG FORMAT  
**Regulation:** § 395.8 - "What Must the Record of Duty Status Include?"

**What's Wrong:**
Your current PDF doesn't match the official ELD format at all.

**Required Format:**
```
Off
Duty     |__|‾‾|__|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|__|
          M  2  4  6  8  10  N  2  4  6  8  10  M

Sleeper  |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|__|__|__|
Berth     

Driving  |__|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾‾|__|__|
          
On Duty  |‾‾‾|__|__|‾‾|__|__|‾‾‾‾‾‾|
(Not
Driving)  

REMARKS: Richmond, VA | Fredericksburg, VA | Baltimore, MD
```

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# New PDF generation with proper grid
def draw_eld_grid(canvas, log_data):
    # Draw 4 horizontal rows (Off Duty, Sleeper, Driving, On Duty)
    # Draw 24 vertical hour lines (Midnight through 23)
    # Draw duty status lines showing transitions
    # Add location markers in Remarks section
```

**Reference:** See pages 15-19 of FMCSA guide (images you sent)

---

### 5. **Duty Status Categories** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** INCOMPLETE  
**Regulation:** § 395.2 definitions

**What's Missing:**
Currently only tracking "driving" but need **4 distinct statuses**:

| Status | Definition | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Off Duty** | Relieved from all work | Meal breaks, personal time, hotel |
| **Sleeper Berth** | Resting in truck's sleeper | 7-hour or 10-hour rest breaks |
| **Driving** | Behind the wheel, CMV in motion | All driving time |
| **On Duty (Not Driving)** | Working but not driving | Loading, inspecting, fueling, paperwork |

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# Update all schedule items
activity_types = {
    'Pre-Trip Inspection': 'on_duty_not_driving',
    'Driving': 'driving',
    'Fueling': 'on_duty_not_driving',
    '30-Minute Break': 'off_duty',  # or 'sleeper_berth'
    '10-Hour Rest': 'sleeper_berth',
    'Pickup': 'on_duty_not_driving',
    'Dropoff': 'on_duty_not_driving',
}
```

---

### 6. **Location Tracking** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Regulation:** § 395.8 - Remarks section

**What's Missing:**
- Must record **city, state** for EVERY duty status change
- Shown in "Remarks" section of ELD log
- Format: "Richmond, VA" or "Highway 95 MP 128, Baltimore, MD"

**Implementation Required:**
```python
# Add to each schedule item
{
    'location': {
        'city': 'Richmond',
        'state': 'VA',
        'coordinates': {'lat': 37.5407, 'lon': -77.4360}
    }
}

# Use reverse geocoding API to get city/state from coordinates
```

**UI Changes:**
- Show locations on map with markers
- Display in schedule: "3:00 PM - Fueling (Fredericksburg, VA)"

## ⚠️ Priority 3: Exceptions & Special Cases

## 💡 Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1** - fixing the ELD PDF format and adding proper duty status tracking. These are the most visible improvements and critical for compliance.

The split sleeper berth feature (Phase 2) is complex but can be added incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

Would you like me to implement any of these features now?
